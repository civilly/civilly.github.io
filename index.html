            <p>Sian’s friends and clients describe her as warm, vivacious and engaging, with a fun and practical approach to life. An experienced and accomplished public speaker, Sian is confident and competent in addressing an intimate group of family and
              friends, or an audience of hundreds.
              <br>
              <br>Initially qualified as a lawyer, Sian’s career has more recently been in human resources and management consulting. Her current full time occupation is as a loving mum!
              <br>
              <br>She lives in Carnegie with her husband and two young children and is also fortunate enough to spend a lot of time in and around Porepunkah in the North East of Victoria, where she has family.
              <br>
              <br>Sian’s interest in being a civil celebrant stems from her belief in the importance of relationships and commitment, her passion for friendships and social connection, and her appreciation for celebration.

              <p>Hi Sian,<br>
                M and I cannot even begin to thank you enough for yesterday, you made our day really special and we are so grateful.<br>
                So many of our guests spoke to us during the night about how beautiful the ceremony was but also how fantastic you were. You made it so easy for M and I and even though we were both pretty nervous, you were able to keep us calm and smiling :o)<br>
                We wish you and your family all the best for the future.<br>
                Warmest regards and thanks,<br>
                R & M</p>
